## Fancy Controls
Fancy Controls is a mod for [Minecraft], a game by [Mojang AB].  
The mod is based on [MinecraftForge] and needs it installed in order to work.    


**Fancy Controls is currently in the stage of early development.**  
**Most of the intented behavior is not yet implemented.**


### What is it about?
We all know that vanilla buttons are boring.
There's not enough ways of controlling all the crazy contraptions in style!   
Fancy Controls presents new variations of doing so:
Switches, Levers, Buttons, Locks, Pads, Handles...  
<sub><sup>*There is supposed to be a proper description. However, our
inspiration isn't currently receiving enough funding to make it so.*</sup></sub>


### Credits
ZigTheHedge is the idea's author. His original mod
[Evolved Controls] has never came out of alpha and was abandoned.
